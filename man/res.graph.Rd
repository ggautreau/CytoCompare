}
\arguments{
\item{res}{a RES object}

\item{filename}{a character specifying a file location where to save the HTML file of the representation}

\item{svgsize}{a numeric value specifying the size of the SVG representation in pixels}

\item{pvalue.th}{a numeric value specifying a p-value cutoff. Only the associations below this specific value will be returned}
}
\value{
none

\description{
Creates a circular graph representation of the comparison results. In such graph representation, each cytometry profile is represented by a node and links between the nodes represent significant similarities or inclusions between the profiles. Nodes are positioned on a circular layout and organized based on their object names.
}
\details{
The representation is provided as an interactive HTML file via a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) element created with the D3.js library. Users can interact with the representation by modifying the link tensions and the p-value cutoff for the significant similarities or inclusions.
